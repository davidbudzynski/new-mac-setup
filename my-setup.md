### **Some of these extensions require some initial setup**

#### Medium Unlimited

follow instructions for your browser [here](https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited)

#### Stylus

I primarily use this extension to set dark mode for GitHub but it can be used for any other website. Most of them can be found of [this page](https://userstyles.org/) - it's quite slow though.

To set github dark mode follow [these instructions](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark)

#### Tablis

I set it so it loads a new photo with every new tab, set the time to 24-hour digital with minutes and date. Finally, I set the time and date font to Monaco.

## Fonts I Like

Few of the fonts that I like and switch between are [SF Pro](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/), [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/styles), and [Anonymous Pro](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro).
