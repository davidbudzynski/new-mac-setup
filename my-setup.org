#+TITLE: My Setup
* Setting up MacOS for web development and data science

** Install CLI tools

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

** Homebrew

Install Homebrew and check for updates

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew update
#+END_SRC

** Install development tools

| Item       | Purpose                                     |
|------------+---------------------------------------------|
| R          | data science                                |
| Java       | required for compilation of some R packages |
| Git        | version control                             |
| PostgreSQL | relational database                         |
| MongoDB    | non-relational database                     |

/Note/: *DO NOT* try to install R via Homebrew because X11 won't work and you will come across all sorts of problems. You need to go to the official web site for the download.

*** Some of these extensions require initial setup
**** Medium Unlimited
follow instructions for your browser [[https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited][here]]
**** Tabliss
I set it so it loads a new photo with every new tab, set the time to 24-hour digital with minutes and date. Finally, I set the time and date font to Monaco.

** Fonts I Like
The fonts that I use in my IDEs and often switch between are:
+ San Francisco Pro
+ Operator Mono
+ Anonumous Pro
+ IBM Plex Mono (my current favourite)
