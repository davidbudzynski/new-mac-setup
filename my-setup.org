#+TITLE: My Setup
* Setting up MacOS for web development and data science

I often have to set up my macs often. I created this document so it is easier for me to do so. This guide get updated from time to time, depending on what tools I use and what technology I am working with at the moment.

** Getting started

Once you go through the setup assistant when you turn the computer for the first time, update MacOS to get the latest security updates and patches.
** Install CLI tools

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

** Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager, it allows you to install almost any app from the command line. Install Homebrew and check for updates.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew update
#+END_SRC

** Install development tools

| Item       | Purpose                                              |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| R          | data science                                         |
| Java       | required for compilation of some R packages          |
| Vim        | text editor                                          |
| Git        | version control                                      |
| PostgreSQL | relational database ([[https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Homebrew][instalation and setup docs]])     |
| MongoDB    | non-relational database ([[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/][instalation and setup docs]]) |
| tmux       | terminal multiplexer                                 |

/Note/ *DO NOT* try to install R via Homebrew because X11 won't work and you will come across all sorts of problems. You need to go to [[https://www.r-project.org/][the official web site]] for the download.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install \
    git \
    make \
    vim \
    tmux \
    postgresql && # this one requires some extra steps: see the docs
    brew tap mongodb/brew &&
    brew install mongodb-community
#+END_SRC

** Install apps

Here are programs that I install. I try to stick to free and open source software as much as I can.

*** App setup
**** Emacs
I use DOOM Emacs distribution since it was created for Vim refugees like me and it comes with sensible defaults and requires minimal amount of tweaking before it can be usable. Its creator is very active on Discord, where you can learn everything related to Emacs. I have my own dotfiles for doom emacs that I copy over to every new computer.
**** Vim
Although I don't use it often, I like having it set up the way I like it. Config available in my dofiles.
**** iTerm2
1. Change the default theme if I feel like having light theme for a change.
2. Enable natural language editing (jumping words with option and arrows, etc.)
**** Alacritty
Very fast, GPU accelerated terminal emulator. It is minimal and doesn't even come with GUI settings section. For the settings, go see my dotfiles.

** Shell
Since macOS Catalina, zsh is the default shell. For easy setup, install *Oh My ZSH*.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC

I think it doesn't really provide anything you couldn't achieve with a little of manual labor:
 + spaceship prompt
 + custom plugins

** Node.js

Use Node Version Manager (NVM) to install and manage different versions of Node.

installing the NVM

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
#+END_SRC

Making sure it loads in your terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
#+END_SRC


getting the latest version of node

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nvm install node
#+END_SRC

** Browser extensions

Normally, they should get installed automatically by signing into browsers' accounts by here's the list of extensions that I use.

*** Some of these extensions require initial setup
**** Medium Unlimited
follow instructions for your browser [[https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited][here]]
**** Tabliss
I set it so it loads a new photo with every new tab, set the time to 24-hour digital with minutes and date. Finally, I set the time and date font to Monaco.

** Fonts I Like
The fonts that I use in my IDEs and often switch between are:
+ San Francisco Pro
+ Operator Mono
+ Anonumous Pro
+ IBM Plex Mono (my current favourite)
